# Figures

For each of the figures in the paper, we created a corrisponding figure that displays the same data.

For some clustering and case visualisations, we received slightly different results. 

Following visualisations were additionally created and extend the analysis of the paper:
1. Examplary gradients of selected countries
2. A world map which conveys the cluster assignments of the previous analysis in a global context
