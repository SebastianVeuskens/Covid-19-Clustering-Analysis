## Clustering Analysis of countries using the COVID-19 cases dataset


### Questions for feedback
 - In 1a dataset, the last columns are unnamed: Shall we leave them or delete them during reading? 
 - Different countries are displayed in the paper and in our project
    - e.g. Fig. 5, our second highest country is Gibraltar-United Kingdom, which is also consistent with the given dataset, but is not included in the paper figure
