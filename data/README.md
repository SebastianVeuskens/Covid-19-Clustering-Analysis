# Datasets

In the analysed research paper 6 datasets were used and preprocessed. 

- [Absolute cases from the first day with cases recorded](data/Coronavirus_Data_Cases_1a.%20Per%20day.csv)  
- [Absolute cases from the 22nd of January until 4th of April 2020](data/Coronavirus_Data_Cases_1b.%20Per%20date.csv)
- [Absolute cases per 1 million population from the first day with cases recorded](data/Coronavirus_Data_Cases_2a.%20Per%20day_population.csv)  
- [Absolute cases per 1 million population from the 22nd of January until 4th of April 2020](data/Coronavirus_Data_Cases_2b.%20Per%20date_population.csv)
- [Absolute cases per 1 million population per area from the first day with cases recorded](data/Coronavirus_Data_Cases_5a.%20Per%20day_popul_surf.csv)  
- [Absolute cases per 1 million population per area from the 22nd of January until 4th of April 2020](data/Coronavirus_Data_Cases_5a.%20Per%20date_popul_surf.csv)

Each of these datasets possesses certain characteristics concerning the time measure (days or date). In addition to the absolute cases, the cases per 1 million population and cases per 1 million population per land area were recorded. 

The datasets contain different statistics, e.g. the population number or land area for each country.
